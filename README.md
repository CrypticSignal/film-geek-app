## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/esther615kim/film-geek-app.git
$ cd film-geek-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You will then be presented with a few options such as viewing the application in a web browser, running it on Android Studio's virtual device or your physical device. If opting for the first option, I recommend using Chrome, opening the developer tools and choosing a mobile device such as the Pixel 5. This is because this app was developed for mobiles, and therefore the UI is not optimised for a laptop display or monitor.

To open the developer tools, right-click anywhere on the webpage and click on **Inspect**. Then, to view the app as you would on a mobile device, open the device toolbar (click on the icon just to the left of the **Console** tab), click on the dropdown menu to the left of the page dimensions and select a mobile device.
